Unfortunately, despite having lived seven years in the Richmond, I don't know very
much about any of these people. I was broadly satisfied with Sandra Lee Fewer (the
retiring incumbent), and as a general matter, I prefer to support people whose
perspective is more social democratic than mainstream Democrat.

I wish it weren't COVID time. I'd make an effort to meet and speak with these
neighbors of mine.

In candidates' self-presentation, there's frankly a lot of boilerplate and personal
story treacle and positions that are broadly popular to say (although not necessarily
popular to act upon) among civilized San Franciscans. Without personal information
or strong differentiation, I'm relying more than I like on endorsements and associations.

Chan seems to be the prominent social democrat in the race (and Philhour the most
prominent mainstream Democrat). If I had a strong reason to prefer another candidate
on local, material issues, I'd be open. But absent such information, I'll go
with the person who seems closest to my general (very strong) political preference.

With Lee I like the "bring BART to the Richmond" emphasis, don't love the anti-tax pledge.

I like that D'Sylvia is relentlessly material and local in his concerns. I might
prefer him if we were choosing a Mayor for the naighborhood. But I worry about
where he'd stand on broader issues and in coalitions with other supervisors. San
Francisco is more small nation than small town. Unfortunately.

With Philhour, as with Chan, I feel feel like a lack very specific information, other
than associations and endorsements. Her issue statements seem fine, but pretty much
everybody's (except Lee and D'Sylva) are similar. By her endorsements and associations,
she's the mainstream Democrat in the race, and absent countervailing information, I'll
prefer candidates who seem more strongly social democratic than that.

With Andrew N. Majalya and Amanda Innocencio, I just don't have a very strong sense of
how to pigeonhole them, where he'd stand on matters of that are likely to be in contention,
whether they'd reflect my views. Mostly the same with Veronica Shinzato, thogh I like
her claim to independence.
