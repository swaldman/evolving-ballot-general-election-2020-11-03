# CA, Proposition 24

**AMENDS CONSUMER PRIVACY LAWS. INITIATIVE STATUTE.**

Permits consumers to: prevent businesses from sharing personal information, correct inaccurate personal information, and limit businesses' use of "sensitive personal information," including precise geolocation, race, ethnicity, and health information. Establishes California Privacy Protection Agency. Fiscal Impact: Increased annual state costs of at least $10 million, but unlikely exceeding low tens of millions of dollars, to enforce expanded consumer privacy laws. Some costs would be offset by penalties for violating these laws.

I'm torn on this one.

Entities that collect user data have, ethically, a fiduciary duty towards those users many of them have consistently
shirked and betrayed.

Unless I'm persuaded of terrible side effects that I'm missing (and I would count disruption of a lot of existing
platforms and business models as _good_ side effects), I'd be inclined to vote in favor of this. I am concerned by potential
impacts on competition, is this the kind of proposal that will give well-capitalized incumbents a large advantage?

I am heartened by this, from a [piece arguing against the propostion](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/15/editorial-prop-24-privacy/) (ht [Pat Signoret](https://twitter.com/patsignoret/status/1314613931575369728)):

> It would allow the Legislature to approve an amendment with a simple majority vote — with this caveat: “The law should be amended, if necessary, to improve its operation, provided that the amendments do not compromise or weaken consumer privacy, while giving attention to the impact on business and innovation.”

> Wow.

> How much “attention” needs to be given to the impact on business and innovation? Does it mean that a law strengthening consumer privacy is illegal if it negatively impacts business?

I think most ballot propositions should be written this way, making them basically legislative acts forced by the public rather than
superlaws difficult to dislodge. So long as our political system contains the huge _status quo_ bias it currently has, getting an ordinary law
passed that otherwise wouldn't usually has serious effect. Most laws won't just immediately be overridden by the legislature or anything like that.
(The main exceptions would be matters in which the legislature for some reason is broadly opposed to a public view, rather than conflicted and
incapable of acting. But that's rare.)

I don't like the "pay for privacy" framework that the League of Women Voters [claims it would enshrine](https://lwvc.org/vote/elections/ballot-recommendations/prop-24consumer-data-privacy). (also ht [Pat Signoret](https://twitter.com/patsignoret/status/1314613931575369728) The notion that the problem is absence of consumer compensation for the way digital incumbents use data, rather than the way that they use data full stop, is badly misguided. These firms' data misuse is not (mostly) and crime against us individually. It's a crime against us collectively. We simply don't want them to be have license to put us under surveillance and use the predictive insights they gain any way they please. Whether an individual data's is "anonymized" (usually unpersuasively) out outright excluded is not really the issue.

But to be fair, I don't think any of the current round of data privacy laws understand this point. The general flawed framework is looking to the balance between individuals' welfare and "innovation", which mostly misses the problem. Given that, is this better than the _status quo ante_?

Ultimately I left this blank.
