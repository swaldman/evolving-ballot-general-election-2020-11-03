# CA, Proposition 24

**AMENDS CONSUMER PRIVACY LAWS. INITIATIVE STATUTE.**

Permits consumers to: prevent businesses from sharing personal information, correct inaccurate personal information, and limit businesses' use of "sensitive personal information," including precise geolocation, race, ethnicity, and health information. Establishes California Privacy Protection Agency. Fiscal Impact: Increased annual state costs of at least $10 million, but unlikely exceeding low tens of millions of dollars, to enforce expanded consumer privacy laws. Some costs would be offset by penalties for violating these laws.

I'm leaning "yes".

Entities that collect user data have, ethically, a fiduciary duty towards those users many of them have consistently
shirked and betrayed.

Unless I'm persuaded of terrible side effects that I'm missing (and I would count disruption of a lot of existing
platforms and business models as _good_ side effects), I'll probably vote in favor of this.
