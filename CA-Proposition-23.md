I don't yet know.

I don't understand the impetus here, or how to weigh the trade-offs.

It seems like this is in response to significant shortcomings in dialysis provision. But why the hell do we have to
regulate medical care by ballot propsotion? Isn't this exactly the kind of thing professionals at regulatory agencies
should be charged with working out?
