# CA, Proposition 16

**ALLOWS DIVERSITY AS A FACTOR IN PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION, AND CONTRACTING DECISIONS. LEGISLATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.**

Permits government decision-making policies to consider race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in order to address diversity by repealing constitutional provision prohibiting such policies. Fiscal Impact: No direct fiscal effect on state and local entities. The effects of the measure depend on the future choices of state and local government entities and are highly uncertain.

I am undecided on this proposition, and may skip it. (I did skip it.)

On the one hand, stratification of opportunity and outcome by "race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin" is an injustice and absolute catastrophe
that we must remedy.

On the other hand, I think the current politics that emphasizes those characteristics in political disputes and personnel decisions increase the salience
of those divisions in ways that are likely to be harmful to the polity as a whole, as well as to the very victims of injustice those politics purport to
help. ([Perversity, rhetoric of reaction?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rhetoric_of_Reaction))

I favor race- (or sex- etc) conscious development of facially neutral programs to remedy sever injustices surrounding categories
like "race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin". (See, for example, the
[baby bonds](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227301907_Can_'Baby_Bonds'_Eliminate_the_Racial_Wealth_Gap_in_Putative_Post-Racial_America)
proposed by Darick Hamilton and William Darity.)

I'd have a hard time voting against this proposition, because I so favor the causes it intends to serve. But I have very mixed feelings about _how_
it intends to serve those causes. For now I remain undecided and might skip it.
