Fiscal Impact: Increase in state and local correctional, court, and law enforcement costs likely in the tens of millions of dollars annually, depending on implementation.

I don't yet understand what motivates this proposition, but in my view we incarcerate much too much, we should expand parole and increase the threshold
of misbehavior we label as "felony".

Unless I am missing something, this is a clear "no" for me.
