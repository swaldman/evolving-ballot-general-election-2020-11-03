# US Representative, District 11

- [ ] Nancy Pelosi
- [x] Shahid Buttar


Nancy Pelosi is a colorful and divisive figure, but she actively opposes any
serious social democratic economic program. The only way, under the current
electoral system (which we should change) that social democracy can succeed
in the United States is by discipline Democratic incumbents who betray social
democratic ideals whenever the cost of doing so is tolerable. Buttar is a
Democrat, a "progressive", and at least in his rhetoric tilts towards social
democracy. Fairly or not, in my view Pelosi, while socially liberal, is philosophically
a devoted neoliberal and politically beholden to plutocratic interests.
This is an easy call for me.
