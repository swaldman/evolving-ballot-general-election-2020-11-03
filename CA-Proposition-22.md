This is a clear "no" for me.

If your value-add is circumventing labor protections, you are just acting as a predator on behalf of your customers and yourselves.
I'd like us to come to an accommodation where the interests of drivers and consumers (I don't much care about the platforms, we should
just municipalize them) are reasonably balanced, where riders face a competitive market but drivers have a baseline of security.

Just calling drivers independent contractors so platforms can stiff them on benefits is the opposite of such an accommodation.
It's bad, even if I would benefit from that stiffing as a rider.
