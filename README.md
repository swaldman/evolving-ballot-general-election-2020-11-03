# Evolving Ballot, General Election - November 3, 2020

_This exercise is inspired by Devon Zuegel, who described doing something similar among her housemates._

This repository is in the public domain.

The idea here is to have people post ballots containing anticipated votes and justifications as a way of pooling
expertise in forming voting decisions. You are encouraged to fork this repository, offer pull requests to help me
fill-in races (especially those about which I'm uncertain), and modify your own repository to match your ballot and
reflect your current leanings.

In order to maximize commonality with others (ballots can differ from one city block to the next!) -- or really to minimize
"merge conflicts" -- I'll make a separate file for each race on my ballot, and omit candidates less likely to be on others'
ballots unless I wish to vote or comment on them.

This repo is incomplete.
Anything in this repo can change and "evolve" until I've actually cast my ballot. (Once I have, I'll note that in this README.)

My ballot is [San Francisco, Type 23](https://sites.omniballot.us/06075/app/sb/sample-ballot).

In this repo I reproduce ballot questions, **_but often incompletely_** and no doubt **_sometimes mistakenly_**.
Please read your own ballot carefully! **_I do not warrant I haven't messed anything up._**
