# CA Assembly, District 19

- [ ] John P. McDonnell
- [x] Phil Ting

In this election -- unusually -- I think it in the national interest that
the Trump-inflected Republican Party be overwhelmingly and unambiguously
reputiated, so I am refraining from giving serious consideration to people
running as Republicans.

(I don't love the Democratic Party either, and don't
think San Francisco or California are well-governed. But
given a binary choice between a Democrat and a Republican
while the Republican Party is led by Donald Trump, I'll take
the Democrat.)

I don't have a strong view of Ting one way or another, but he is likely
to get my vote by default.
