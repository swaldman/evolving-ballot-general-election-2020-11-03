# SF, Proposition C

Shall the City amend the Charter to remove the requirement that people serving on City boards, commissions and advisory bodies be registered voters and U.S. citizens, and continue to require those people be old enough to vote in City elections and be San Francisco residents?

- [x] Yes
- [ ] No

Noncitizen residents are full residents of our community, with an interest in their betterment and skills to offer.
Of course they should be able to serve on "City boards, commissions and advisory bodies".
