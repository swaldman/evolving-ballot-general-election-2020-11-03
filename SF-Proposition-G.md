# SF, Proposition G

Shall the City amend the Charter to allow San Francisco residents to vote for local candidates and local ballot measures if they are U.S. citizens, at least 16 years old and registered to vote?

- [x] Yes
- [ ] No

I think it's a great idea to get 16-year-olds in the habit of voting, and local elections are a great place to start.
Maybe youth turnout will be (salubriously) higher in general if high-school civics curricula can prime the voting pump.
