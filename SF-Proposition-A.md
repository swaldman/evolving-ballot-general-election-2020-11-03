# SF, Proposition A

HEALTH AND RECOVERY BONDS. To finance the acquisition or improvement of real property, including to: stabilize, improve, and make permanent investments in supportive housing facilities, shelters, and/or facilities that deliver services to persons experiencing mental health challenges, substance use disorder, and/or homelessness; improve the accessibility, safety and quality of parks, open spaces and recreation facilities; improve the accessibility, safety and condition of the Cityâ€™s streets and other public right-of-way and related assets; and to pay related costs; shall the City and County of San Francisco issue $487,500,000 in general obligation bonds with a duration of up to 30 years from the time of issuance, an estimated average tax rate of $0.014/$100 of assessed property value, and projected average annual revenues of $40,000,000, subject to independent citizen oversight and regular audits? The City's current debt management policy is to keep the property tax rate for City general obligation bonds below the 2006 rate by issuing new bonds as older ones are retired and the tax base grows, though this property tax rate may vary based on other factors.

How to finance expiring debt is properly the role of the managers of an entity. San Francisco's full Board of Supervisors
endorses this. Not authorizing it would be throwing a debt-ceiling-like spanner into the works.
