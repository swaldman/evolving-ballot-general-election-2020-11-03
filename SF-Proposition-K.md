# SF, Proposition K

Shall the City have the authority to own, develop, construct, acquire or rehabilitate up to 10,000 units of low-income rental housing in San Francisco?

- [x] Yes
- [ ] No

---

Cities should be active producers and purveyors of housing (and not just low-income housing), rather than relying on the market
and using land-user regulations and density bonuses and stuff to cumbersomely shape outcomes.
