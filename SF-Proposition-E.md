# SF, Proposition E

Shall the City amend the Charter to remove the requirement that the San Francisco Police Department maintain a minimum of 1,971 full-duty sworn police officers and replace the requirement with regular evaluations of police staffing levels?

- [x] Yes
- [ ] No

---

There's no public-interest reason for a hard floor in the number of police officers to be hardwired into the Charter.
Our elected officials and the administrators to whom they delegate should make these choices.
