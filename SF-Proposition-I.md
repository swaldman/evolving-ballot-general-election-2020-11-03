# SF, Proposition I

Shall the City permanently increase the transfer tax rate on sales and leases of 35 years or more of real estate, to 5.50% on those transactions of $10 million to $25 million, and to 6.00% on those transactions of $25 million or more, for an estimated average revenue of $196 million a year?

- [x] Yes
- [ ] No

The city needs revenue, and taxing high levels of wealth is good for the polity. Win-win.
