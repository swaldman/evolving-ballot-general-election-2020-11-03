# US President and Vice President

- [x] Joseph R. Biden / Kamala D. Harris
- [ ] Donald J. Trump / Michael R. Pence

This is an easy one.

While there's lots of things about the `#Resistance` I find overwrought,
hypocritical, and disagreeable, I think that Donald Trump has proved to be
a terrible President in terms of basic competence, his inclination to incite
rather than salve social divisions, his own values, and the value and interests
of the political coalition he represents.

Joe Biden would not be my first, second, or third choice from even the narrow universe
of primary candidates. But I do think he would not set the country against itself, and he
would build an administrtion with some basic competences and values that the current
one lacks.

I do agree with the "normcore" `#Resistance` that Trump and the coalition
he represents and has reshaped is a more serious threat to prospects for open democracy
and universal political enfranchisement than his rival (though none of the current
options are very good or without serious risks on these dimensions).

Social democracy -- my political priority -- is not on the Presidential ballot
this year. But both because his administration would be basically more rational
and competent, and because his political coalition is a bit more open to it
than the other one (although they are both, at bottom, implacably hostile to it, alas),
Biden / Harris is my unambiguous Presidential choice.

_**Note:** I don't consider less prominent candidates because under our crappy
plurality voting system, voting for minor party candidates splits the coalition closest
to my own values and interests._

_I want desperately to change our voting system. But that is not on this ballot._
