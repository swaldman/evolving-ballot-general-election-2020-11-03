This is an obvious "yes".

I believe that, at the very least, every adult citizen of the United States should have the franchise. (Under some circumstances, for some
but not all votes, I also think lawful non-citizen residents and minors perhaps should.) I'd support restoring the franchise to current prisoners,
who have not yet completed their terms. Prisoners' interest in the quality of government management and service provision is, um, heightened.

This is a good start.
