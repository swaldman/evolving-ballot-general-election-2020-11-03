This is a clear "yes" for me.

The only answer to housing scarcity is housing abundance. However, housing is much more than a mere commodity. It is the center and sinew of
every lived community. The "Market YIMBY" prescription for housing abundance -- pare back land-use restrictions and let the market rip -- I do not favor.
We need to build a tremendous amount of housing, but how and where we do it should be subject to democratic choice (not necessarily at the neighborhood level!),
not a "creative destruction" market outcome.

In the meantime, while housing is not abundant. Rent control (ideally rent stabilization with vacancy decontrol) is a useful tool for preserving lived
communities. Rent control has winners and losers. The winners tend to be incumbent renters, the losers those who'd like to move into a community.
But privileging incumbents' interests in lived communities over those of would-be migrants is legitimate, when there is a zero-sum tradeoff. The more
ethical choice would be to eliminate the scarcity that creates such horrid trade-offs, but in the meantime, rent control is a useful tool for communities
and whether to impose it should be a local choice.
