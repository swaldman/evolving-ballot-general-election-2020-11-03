# SF, Proposition J

Shall the City replace its 2018 Parcel Tax for the San Francisco Unified School District with a new tax that changes the annual tax rate from $320 per parcel to $288 per parcel, adjusted for inflation each year, and with an exemption for people age 65 or older, until June 30, 2038, for an estimated revenue of $48.1 million a year?

- [x] Yes
- [ ] No

I relied mostly on the [SF League of Pissed Off Voters'](https://www.theleaguesf.org/) discussion and endorsement.
