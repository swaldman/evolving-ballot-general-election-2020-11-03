I have to look into this more.

On the one hand, my personal preference is for a lot more dynamism in the built environment.

On the other hand, to the degree that dynamism is unleashed purely by market forces, it's likely to be heedless of important
community values and have a plutocratic bent.

So I'm not sure.
