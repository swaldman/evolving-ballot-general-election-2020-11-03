# SF, Proposition H

Shall the City change the Planning Code for neighborhood commercial districts to increase permissible uses, eliminate public notification processes for new permitted uses, and require an expedited process for permits?

- [ ] No

On the one hand, my personal preference is for a lot more dynamism in the built environment.

On the other hand, to the degree that dynamism is unleashed purely by market forces, it's likely to be heedless of important
community values and have a plutocratic bent.

So I'm not sure.

Ultimately I voted "yes" on this one, largely because it permits a thing that might really affect my quality of life. It authorizes
restaurants to provide services as coworking spaces. For now, absurdly, it's hard to find coworking spaces in mant of SF's residential
areas (including my own Inner Richmond). I have to commute downtown, which strikes me as absurd. (I love the space, but hate the commute.)
My strong personal interest in this particular aspect of the proposal tilted me from ambivalent to "yes".
