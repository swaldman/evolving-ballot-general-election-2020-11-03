# CA Senator, District 11

- [x] Scott Wiener
- [ ] Jackie Fielder

---

This was the hardest decision on the ballot for me.

I am a person whose core political priority is social democracy,
in the sense of enshrining a generous, universal benefits state and
limiting economic inequality. Like many people with my priorities,
I feel generally betrayed by and angry with the "center" of the
Democratic Party, whose economics I perceive as neoliberal,
corrupted by a plutocratic donor class and the class interests
of the affluent part of professional/managerial class that
largely comprises it.

From this perspective, Scott Wiener is a guy I should be eager
to vote against, and Jackie Fielder should be my clear choice.
I make a strong effort to "brand" my political activity (votes,
donations) as coming from a social democratic place, in opposition
to what I see as a destructive "progressive" neoliberalism.
Wiener's first endorsement is Nancy Pelosi, which is an
anti-endorsement to me, while Fielder is endorsed by
Our Revolution, which I support.

Despite all of this, I've been impressed by Wiener. He started
out, I think it is fair to say as a "Market YIMBY", but opened
his views to the concerns of people who tend to lose out when
the market is let to have its way as he shaped and reshaped
SB-50. I perceive him as having been dogged and energetic in
office, succed or fail (as his signature SB-50 did fail).

I don't know much about Jackie Fielder as an individual, but by
her endorsements and association, ordinarily she would be my clear
choice. But the way Wiener has conducted himself as a State Senator
(in contrast to his prior role in San Francisco politics) gives
me pause, makes me wonder if he shouldn't be rewarded with my
vote, despite his coalitional identity.

(I remained torn throughout, but did vote for Wiener.)
